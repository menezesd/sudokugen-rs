Sudoku Generator in Rust
A Rust implementation of a Sudoku puzzle generator that creates valid Sudoku grids with a unique solution. This project demonstrates the use of backtracking algorithms and random number generation to build and solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently.

Features

Sudoku Grid Generation: Generates a completely filled 9x9 Sudoku grid using a randomized backtracking algorithm.
Puzzle Creation: Removes cells from the filled grid to create a solvable puzzle of adjustable difficulty.
Unique Solution Check: Ensures the generated puzzle has exactly one valid solution.
Difficulty Adjustment: Allows specifying the number of cells to retain (higher values mean easier puzzles).
